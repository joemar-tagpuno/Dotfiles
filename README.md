# Dotfiles

Dotfiles are the customization files that are used to personalize your Linux or other Unix-based system.  You can tell that a file is a dotfile because the name of the file will begin with a period--a dot!  The period at the beginning of a filename or directory name indicates that it is a hidden file or directory. This repository contains my personal dotfiles.  They are stored here for convenience so that I may quickly access them on new machines or new installs.

A great place to start is "Your unofficial guide to dotfiles on [GitHub](https://dotfiles.github.io/)".

I use the git bare repository method for managing my dotfiles: [The best way to store your dotfiles: A bare Git repository](https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2016/02/best-way-to-store-dotfiles-git-bare-repo).
